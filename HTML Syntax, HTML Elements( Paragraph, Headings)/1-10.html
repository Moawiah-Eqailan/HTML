            <p>Mathematics is the <mark >science and science of quality,structure,space and change.</mark> Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.</p>
            <p>

                There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce</b> called mathematics <u>"the science that draws necessary conclusions".</u><mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that <u>"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."</u></p>

                <p><u>Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including natural science,</u> engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any application in mind, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.   </p>

    <del>Chemistry is the branch of science dealing with the structure, composition, properties, and the reactive characteristics of matter. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. </del>, chemistry is the study of literally everything around us â€“ the liquids that we drink, the gasses we breathe, the composition of everything from the plastic case on your phone to the earth beneath your feet. Moreover, <mark> chemistry</mark> is the study of the transformation of matter.
